/*
This program seeks to solve the dining philosophers' problem using channels.

It is my implementation of Djikstra's proposed solution of assigning a 
global ordering to the forks and making sure that the philosophers check 
whether forks are available with respect to this ordering.

For more details see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem
