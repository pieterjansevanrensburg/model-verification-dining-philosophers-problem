/*
This program seeks to solve the generalized dining philosophers' problem 
using channels.

It is my implementation of the Resource Hierarchy Solution proposed by 
Edsger W. Dijkstra.

This solution involves assigning a partial order to the forks and requires that
the forks' availability be checked with respect to said ordering i.e. 
philosophers always checks lower ordered forks first and then higher 
ordered forks.

The partial ordering is simply each fork's position in the array of 
asynchronous channels.

Furthermore, each philosopher is treated as a seperate process that runs in
parallel.

For more details see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem
